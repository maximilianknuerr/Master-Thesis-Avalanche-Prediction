@article{SUGUMARAN2007930,
	abstract = {Roller bearing is one of the most widely used rotary elements in a rotary machine. The roller bearing's nature of vibration reveals its condition and the features that show the nature, are to be extracted through some indirect means. Statistical parameters like kurtosis, standard deviation, maximum value, etc. form a set of features, which are widely used in fault diagnostics. Often the problem is, finding out good features that discriminate the different fault conditions of the bearing. Selection of good features is an important phase in pattern recognition and requires detailed domain knowledge. This paper illustrates the use of a Decision Tree that identifies the best features from a given set of samples for the purpose of classification. It uses Proximal Support Vector Machine (PSVM), which has the capability to efficiently classify the faults using statistical features. The vibration signal from a piezoelectric transducer is captured for the following conditions: good bearing, bearing with inner race fault, bearing with outer race fault, and inner and outer race fault. The statistical features are extracted therefrom and classified successfully using PSVM and SVM. The results of PSVM and SVM are compared.},

@article{Martin:2001,
abstract = {The SAFRAN/Crocus/MÉPRA software is used to assess the climatology of the avalanche hazard and its sensitivity to climate change. A natural avalanche-hazard index based on MEPRA analysis is defined and validated against natural avalanche observations (triggered avalanches are not taken into account). A 15 year climatology then allows a comparison of avalanche hazard in the different French massifs. Finally a simple climate scenario (with a general increase of precipitation and temperature) shows that avalanche hazard may decrease slightly in winter (mainly February) and more significantly in May/June. The relative proportion of wet-snow avalanches increases.},

@article{Bahram:2019,
abstract = {Snow avalanches are among the most destructive natural hazards threatening human life, ecosystems, built structures, and landscapes in mountainous regions. The complexity of snow avalanche modelling has been discussed in many studies, but its modelling is not well-documented. Snow avalanche modeling in this study was done using three main categories of data, including avalanche occurrence locations, meteorological factors, and terrain characteristics. Two machine learning models, namely support vector machine (SVM) and multivariate discriminant analysis (MDA), were employed. A ratio of 70 to 30 of data was considered for calibrating and validating the models. Results indicated that both models had an excellent performance in snow avalanche modeling (area under curve, AUC > 90), although hits and misses analysis demonstrated the superior performance of MDA. Sensitivity analysis indicated that the topographic position index, slope, precipitation, and topographic wetness index were the most effective variables for modeling. A snow avalanche map indicated that the high snow avalanche hazard zone was mostly near the streams and was matched with hillsides around the water pathways. Findings of study can be helpful for land use planning, to control snow avalanche paths, and to prevent the probable hazards induced by it, and it can be a good reference for future studies on modeling snow avalanche hazards.},

@article{Tiwari:2021,
abstract = {Due to ongoing climate change, water mass redistribution and related hazards are getting stronger and frequent. Therefore, predicting extreme hydrological events and related hazards is one of the highest priorities in geosciences. Machine Learning (ML) methods have shown promising prospects in this venture. Every ML method requires training where we know both the output (extreme event) and input (relevant physical parameters and variables). This step is critical to the efficacy of the ML method. The usual approach is to include a wide variety of hydro-meteorological observations and physical parameters, but recent advances in ML indicate that the efficacy of ML may not improve by increasing the number of input parameters. In fact, including unimportant parameters decreases the efficacy of ML algorithms. Therefore, it is imperative that the most relevant parameters are identified prior to training. In this study, we demonstrate this concept by predicting avalanche susceptibility in Leh-Manali highway (one of the most severely affected regions in India) with and without Parameter Importance Assessment (PIA). The avalanche locations were randomly divided into two groups: 70% for training and 30% for testing. Then, based on temporal and spatial sensor data, eleven avalanche influencing parameters were considered. The Boruta algorithm, an extension of Random Forest (RF) ML method that utilizes the importance measure to rank predictors, was used and it found nine out of eleven parameters to be important. Support Vector Machine (SVM) based ML technique is used for avalanche prediction, and to be comprehensive, four different kernel functions were employed (linear, polynomial, sigmoid, and radial basis function (RBF)). The prediction accuracy for linear, polynomial, sigmoid, and RBF kernels, with all the eleven parameters were found to be 80.4%, 81.7%, 39.2%, and 85.7%, respectively. While, when using selected parameters, the prediction accuracy for linear, polynomial, sigmoid, and RBF kernels were 84.1%, 86.6%, 43.0%, and 87.8%, respectively. We also identified locations where occurrences of avalanches are most likely. We conclude that parameter selection should be considered when applying ML methods in geosciences.},

abstract = {Automated detection of snow avalanches is crucial to assess the effectiveness of avalanche control by explosions, and to monitor avalanche activity in a given area in view of avalanche forecasting. Several automated or semi-automated detection technologies have been developed in the past among which infrasound-based detection is the most promising for regional-scale avalanche monitoring. However, due to significant ambient noise content in infrasonic signals, e.g. from atmospheric processes or airplanes, fully automated and reliable avalanche detection has been very challenging. Signal processing is highly critical and strongly affects detection accuracy. Here, a robust detection method by using supervised machine learning is introduced. Machine learning algorithms can take into account multiple signal features and statistically optimize the classification task. We analyzed infrasound data with concurrent visual avalanche observations from the test site Lavin (Eastern Swiss Alps) for the winter of 2011–2012. A support vector machine was trained by using training data from the first half of the winter season and the accuracy was tested on data from the second half of the season. A significant reduction of false detections, from 65% to 10%, was achieved compared to a threshold-based classifier provided by the sensor manufacturer. The proposed method enables reliable assessment of the avalanche activity in the surroundings of the system and paves the way towards robust and fully automated avalanche detection using infrasonic systems.}

In this study, we discuss several frequently-used evaluation measures for feature selection, and then survey supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised feature selection methods, which are widely applied in machine learning problems, such as classification and clustering. Lastly, future challenges about feature selection are discussed.}

title = {Statistical Nowcast of Avalanche Activity at the Regional Scale},
author = {Stephan Harvey, Alec van Herwijnen, Bettina Richter},
year = {2016},
abstract = {Forecasting natural avalanche activity is challenging. Events are relatively rare and several contributory factors affecting the formation of dry- or wet-snow avalanches have to be evaluated. In contrast to previous statistical avalanche forecast models which focus on specific avalanche types or small scales, in this study we developed a model to predict avalanche days for an entire winter season at the regional scale. We therefore analysed an avalanche catalogue consisting of observed avalanches in the region of Davos, Switzerland, over the last 13 years (2003/04 to 2015/16). In combination with data from an automatic weather station and simulated snow cover properties from the model SNOWPACK, we trained random forest models by applying different methods to predict avalanche days. Overall, the predictive performance was in line with other similar studies. However, substantial differences in performance were observed among the 13 winter seasons. Surprisingly, the performance of models without snow cover data from the SNOWPACK simulations was very similar. These results suggest that there is no strong correlation between avalanche activity and snow cover properties, highlighting the limitations of obtained avalanche activity data through visual observations. While more work is still required, the reasonable performance of our statistical model to predict avalanche days show that automatically predicting regional avalanche activity using an automatic weather stations is feasible.},

title={Applying machine learning methods to avalanche forecasting},
abstract={Avalanche forecasting is a complex process involving the assimilation of multiple data sources to make predictions over varying spatial and temporal resolutions. Numerically assisted forecasting often uses nearest-neighbour methods (NN), which are known to have limitations when dealing with high-dimensional data. We apply support vector machines (SVMs) to a dataset from Lochaber, Scotland, UK, to assess their applicability in avalanche forecasting. SVMs belong to a family of theoretically based techniques from machine learning and are designed to deal with high-dimensional data. Initial experiments showed that SVMs gave results that were comparable with NN for categorical and probabilistic forecasts. Experiments utilizing the ability of SVMs to deal with high dimensionality in producing a spatial forecast show promise, but require further work.},
