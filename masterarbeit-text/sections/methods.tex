\section{Methodology}

For machine learning analysis there are some phases to be accomplished. The methods used for processing these stages are explained in this section. The first step to be done is the Data Preprocessing, wich is described in detail in section 3.1. After that the Features Selection phase gets explained in chapter 3.2. Thirdly the Machine learning models needs to be trained. This phase is explained in more depth in chapter 3.3. The final step is to evaluate the performance of the machine learning models in their application to the data set, which is declared in section 3.4.
